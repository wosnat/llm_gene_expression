- Use [Author, Year] citation format

3. Critical Analysis
- Assess the quality and reliability of different research methods
- Identify patterns and themes across studies
- Distinguish between correlation and causation
- Note methodological limitations where relevant

4. Writing Style
- Use active voice for clear attribution of actions
- Maintain parallel structure in lists and comparisons
- Ensure smooth transitions between topics
- Create clear hierarchical organization of ideas
