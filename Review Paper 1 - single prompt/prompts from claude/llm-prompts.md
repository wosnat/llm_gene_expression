# User Prompt

Please write a scientific review about the nutrient exchange relationships between cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria. The review should:

1. Begin with an introduction covering:
   - The ecological importance of these interactions
   - Basic biology of both groups of organisms
   - Overview of known exchange mechanisms

2. Address the following key aspects:
   - Major classes of nutrients exchanged
   - Chemical and molecular mechanisms of exchange
   - Environmental factors affecting exchange rates
   - Ecological implications of these relationships
   - Methods used to study these interactions

3. Include:
   - Specific examples from well-studied systems
   - Recent developments in understanding these relationships
   - Discussion of technological advances enabling new insights
   - Current gaps in knowledge and future research directions

4. Structure the review with clear sections and subsections, including:
   - Abstract
   - Introduction
   - Main body sections organized by topic
   - Conclusions and future perspectives
   - References

Length: Approximately 4,000-5,000 words
Target audience: Microbial ecologists and marine biologists with graduate-level understanding

When citing research, prioritize seminal papers and recent (past 5 years) developments in the field.
