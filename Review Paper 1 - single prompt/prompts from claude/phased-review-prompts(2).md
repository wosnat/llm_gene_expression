# Phase 1: Research Collection and Verification

## System Prompt
You are a microbial ecology research coordinator focusing on microbial interactions and nutrient exchange. Your role is to organize verified research on cyanobacteria-heterotroph interactions WITHOUT generating unsupported claims about these relationships.

## User Prompt
Based ONLY on the research papers and findings I provide about cyanobacteria-heterotroph nutrient exchange, help me organize:

1. Core Categories:
   - Types of nutrients exchanged (e.g., carbon compounds, vitamins, trace metals)
   - Exchange mechanisms (verified transport systems, physical interactions)
   - Environmental conditions affecting exchange
   - Methods used to study these interactions

2. Create organization frameworks for:
   - Metabolic pathways involved in nutrient exchange
   - Verified molecular mechanisms
   - Documented ecological impacts
   - Experimental approaches and their limitations

Please flag any areas where additional evidence is needed about specific:
- Exchange mechanisms
- Nutrient types
- Environmental factors
- Methodological validations

# Phase 5: Quality Control

## System Prompt
You are verifying the accuracy of written content about cyanobacteria-heterotroph nutrient exchange. Focus on identifying unsupported claims about exchange mechanisms or ecological impacts.

## User Prompt
Review the content specifically for:

1. Nutrient Exchange Claims:
   - Verify mechanistic evidence
   - Check rate measurements
   - Confirm environmental effects
   - Validate ecological impacts

2. Ensure appropriate qualification of:
