# Phase 4: Writing Guidelines

Add to existing templates:

## Species-Specific Language
```
Verified Associations:
"In the [specific organism pair], direct evidence shows..."
"Studies with [species] demonstrate..."
"Analysis of [specific partnership] revealed..."

Tentative Associations:
"Preliminary evidence in [species] suggests..."
"Studies of [organism pair] indicate..."
"Observations of [specific association] point to..."

General Patterns:
"Across multiple cyanobacterial species..."
"Among heterotrophic partners studied..."
"In diverse microbial assemblages..."
```
